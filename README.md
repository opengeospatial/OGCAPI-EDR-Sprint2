About the Code Sprint
----------------


The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) invites developers to the OGC API - EDR Sprint 2 virtual event to be held through remote participation/web-conferencing on November 9-10, 2020, from 9:00am 5:30pm [EST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/usa/washington-dc). Registration for the OGC API - EDR Sprint 2 virtual event and the associated pre-event Webinar is [here](https://portal.ogc.org/public_ogc/register/202011q4_api_edr.php).

The code sprint will focus on refining the [OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval candidate standard](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/19-086.html). The candidate standard uses current web technologies and best practices to enable end-users - or anyone with web development experience - to easily identify and retrieve a subset of data from ‘big data’ stores. The idea is to save those users interested in environmental (or other) data from having to transfer and deal with datasets that inevitably contain data concerning areas or time periods that are irrelevant to their interests.
